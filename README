Playing around with the idea of using a QuasiQuoter for key bindings in xmonad
configurations. Currently, it is extremely limited (it can only bind keys to
spawn actions), has some very overcomplicated nonsense, and is not tested well.

Source files are literate Haskell primarily so I can keep notes of what all this
junk is actually supposed to be doing and why it's doing it that way.

Not actually intended for practical use. Maybe after lots of expansion,
simplification, and testing, but certainly not now.
